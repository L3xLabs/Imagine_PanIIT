# AMBIT: An Exclusive Anonymous Corporate Social Media App

## Project Overview

**AMBIT** is an anonymous corporate social media app designed to **reduce workplace stress** and **foster open communication**. This project was created by **LinuxLabs**, a team with a proven track record of success in hackathons and open-source contributions. Notably, the team has won Hackathon at IIT Guwahati and HackCBS 7.0 at SSCBS Delhi, and were finalists at ETHIndiaâ€™24 in Bengaluru. 

The app is based on the **PERMA model**, a scientific theory of well-being.  It addresses the limitations of existing corporate social media platforms, which often lack **exclusivity** and **anonymity**. 

## Problem Statement

Many employees hesitate to provide honest feedback due to fear of repercussions. Existing platforms lack:

*   **Exclusivity:** Open platforms are not tailored for specific company cultures and needs.
*   **Anonymity:**  Employees need a safe space to share feedback without fear of identification.

Research indicates that anonymity encourages feedback and engagement:

*   **75% of employees prefer giving honest feedback anonymously.** (SHRM)
*   **Highly engaged teams show 21% greater profitability and a 41% reduction in absenteeism.** (Gallup)

## Solution

AMBIT provides a secure and anonymous platform for employees to communicate openly. Key features include:

*   **Exclusive platform:** Designed specifically for a company's workforce.
*   **Advanced anonymity:** No user details are recorded, ensuring privacy.
*   **End-to-end encryption:** Communication is secure and protected.
*   **Post visibility control:** Users can control who sees their posts.
*   **Advanced blocking options:** Users can block unwanted interactions.
*   **Cross-platform compatibility:** Accessible on various devices.
*   **Modular plugins:** Extensible functionality for diverse needs.
*   **E2EE chat service:** Secure and private messaging.
*   **User-friendly interface:** Easy to use, even for less tech-savvy individuals.

## Anonymity Management

AMBIT utilises a sophisticated system to maintain anonymity. The process involves:

*   **S1: Node and Key Retrieval:** The client receives a list of nodes and their public keys from the aggregator service.
*   **S2: Multi-layered Encryption:** The message is encrypted in three layers using the public keys of the nodes.
*   **S3: Decentralised Routing and Decryption:** The message follows a random route, decrypting one layer at each node. The final destination receives the original message without knowing the sender.

## Benefits

AMBIT empowers companies to:

*   **Identify employee issues early on.**
*   **Improve employee engagement and morale.**
*   **Create a more transparent and open work environment.**
*   **Increase productivity and profitability.**

## Conclusion

AMBIT offers a unique solution to address the challenges of workplace communication. By prioritising anonymity and security, it provides a platform for honest feedback, leading to a more positive and productive work environment.
